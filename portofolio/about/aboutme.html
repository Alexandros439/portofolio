            <p style="margin: 10px;">My name is Alexandros Hondo, and I have been actively involved in programming for the past four years. During this time, I have developed various personal projects that have helped me strengthen both my problem-solving abilities and my technical skills. I am passionate about creating functional and efficient solutions, and I constantly seek opportunities to challenge myself and grow as a developer.</p>
            <p style="margin: 10px;">My primary programming experience lies in JavaScript, which I have used extensively in most of my projects. I have developed interactive web applications, worked with browser APIs, and written reusable components using modern JavaScript techniques. I have also worked with Python on smaller-scale projects, which has broadened my perspective on different tools and programming approaches.</p>
